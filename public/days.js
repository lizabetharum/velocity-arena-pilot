Run formula calculations for next match prep. This track has a specific prompt in each day's Open Lab description. **Track B: Bot Lab** Experiment with MakeCode. Test a new scoop angle. Try a weird loadout you would never use in a real match. Drive backwards at full speed and observe Turning behavior. No required output. Just bot time. Track choice is self-selected and publicly visible. A team that chooses Bot Lab after a loss is avoiding their data. That tells you something. Do not redirect them immediately. Watch for one full Open Lab. If they choose Bot Lab after two consecutive losses without any dashboard revision, ask one question: \"What would your data tell you if you looked right now?\" Then step back and let them decide. The self-selection is diagnostic, not a problem to fix. Teams that consistently choose Track A are doing the analytical work the program is designed to produce. Teams that consistently choose Track B may be more engaged with the physical system than the mathematical one. Both are valid paths through the program.
